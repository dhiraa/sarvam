PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: The
chapter is a natural capstone

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,840
chapter for this entire course.

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,760
We'll see some of
the things we've

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,910
seen during maximum likelihood
and some of the things

12
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,080
we've seen during linear
regression, some of the things

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,020
we've seen in terms of the basic
modeling that we've had before.

14
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,655
We're not going to go back
to much inference questions.

15
00:00:39,655 --> 00:00:41,280
It's really going to
be about modeling.

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,355
And in a way, generalized
linear models, as the word says,

17
00:00:44,355 --> 00:00:47,010
are just a generalization
of linear models.

18
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,300
And they're actually
extremely useful.

19
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,900
They're often forgotten
about and people just

20
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,720
jump onto machine learning
and sophisticated techniques.

21
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,384
But those things do
the job quite well.

22
00:00:57,384 --> 00:00:59,550
So let's see in what sense
they are a generalization

23
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,250
of the linear models.

24
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,400
So remember, the linear
model looked like this.

25
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:13,030
We said that y was equal to x
transpose beta plus epsilon,

26
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,530
right?

27
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,960
That was our linear
regression model.

28
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,330
And it's-- another way
to say this is that if--

29
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,970
and let's assume
that those were, say,

30
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,230
Gaussian with mean 0 and
identity covariance matrix.

31
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,730
Then another way
to say this is that

32
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:32,700
the conditional distribution
of y given x is equal to--

33
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:39,690
sorry, I a Gaussian with mean
x transpose beta and variance--

34
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:43,440
well, we had a sigma squared,
which I will forget as usual--

35
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,080
x transpose beta and
then sigma squared.

36
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,550
OK, so here, we just assumed
that-- so what is regression

37
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:54,630
is just saying I'm trying to
explain why as a function of x.

38
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,660
Given x, I'm assuming a
distribution for the y.

39
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,460
And this x is just
going to be here

40
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:05,430
to help me model what the mean
of this Gaussian is, right?

41
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,720
I mean, I could have
something crazy.

42
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:13,570
I could have something
that looks like y given

43
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:17,560
x is n0 x transpose beta.

44
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,660
And then this could
be some other thing

45
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,780
which looks like, I don't
know, some x transpose

46
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,950
gamma squared
times, I don't know,

47
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,350
x, x transpose plus identity--

48
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,250
some crazy thing that
depends on x here, right?

49
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,570
And we deliberately assumed that
all the thing that depends on x

50
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,820
shows up in the mean, OK?

51
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,520
And so what I have
here is that y

52
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,640
given x is a Gaussian
with a mean that

53
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:51,240
depends on x and covariance
matrix sigma square identity.

54
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,699
Now the linear model
assumed a very specific form

55
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:55,240
for the mean.

56
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,190
It said I want the
mean to be equal to x

57
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,050
transpose beta
which, remember, was

58
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:10,270
the sum from, say, j equals
1 to p of beta j xj, right?

59
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:13,240
It's where the xj's are
the coordinates of x.

60
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,050
But I could do something
also more complicated, right?

61
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,170
I could have something
that looks like instead ,

62
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:28,990
replace this by, I don't know,
sum of beta j log of x to the j

63
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:34,450
divided by x to the j squared
or something like this, right?

64
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,360
I could do this as well.

65
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,630
So there's two things
that we have assumed.

66
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,520
The first one is
that when I look

67
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,440
at the conditional
distribution of y given x,

68
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,570
x affects only the mean.

69
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,394
I also assume that
it was Gaussian

70
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,810
and that it affects
only the mean.

71
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,130
And the mean is affected
in a very specific way,

72
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,670
which is linear in x, right?

73
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,270
So this is
essentially the things

74
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,230
we're going to try to relax.

75
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,670
So the first thing
that we assume,

76
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:03,300
the fact that y was Gaussian and
had only its mean [INAUDIBLE]

77
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,140
dependant no x is what's
called the random component.

78
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,435
It just says that the
response variables, you know,

79
00:04:09,435 --> 00:04:13,990
it sort of makes sense to
assume that they're Gaussian.

80
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:17,220
And everything was
essentially captured, right?

81
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,779
So there's this
property of Gaussians

82
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:22,069
that if you tell me-- if
the variance is known,

83
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:23,610
all you need to tell
me to understand

84
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,950
exactly what the distribution
of a Gaussian is,

85
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:29,110
all you need to tell me
is its expected value.

86
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,730
All right, so
that's this mu of x.

87
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:35,570
And the second thing is that
we have this link that says,

88
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,600
well, I need to find a way
to use my x's to explain

89
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,370
this mu you and the
link was exactly

90
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,390
mu of x was equal
to x transpose beta.

91
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:51,140
Now we are talking about
generalized linear models.

92
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:56,150
So this part here where mu
of x is of the form-- the way

93
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:00,620
I want my beta, my x,
to show up is linear,

94
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,380
this will never be a question.

95
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,030
In principle, I could
add a third point,

96
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,250
which is just question this
part, the fact that mu of x

97
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,310
is x transpose beta.

98
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,640
I could have some more
complicated, nonlinear function

99
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,300
of x.

100
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,740
And then we'll never do
that because we're talking

101
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,100
about generalized linear model.

102
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,640
The only thing with generalize
are the random component,

103
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,330
the conditional
distribution of y given x,

104
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:26,870
and the link that just says,
well, once you actually tell me

105
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,540
that the only thing I need
to figure out is the mean,

106
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,180
I'm just going to slap it
exactly these x transpose beta

107
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:36,520
thing without any transformation
of x transpose beta.

108
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,750
So those are the two things.

109
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,260
It will become
clear what I mean.

110
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,450
This sounds like a
tautology, but let's just

111
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,730
see how we could extend that.

112
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:50,140
So what we're going to do in
generalized linear models--

113
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:55,482
right, so when I
talk about GLNs,

114
00:05:55,482 --> 00:05:57,190
the first thing I'm
going to do with my x

115
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,330
is turn it into some
x transpose beta.

116
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,372
And that's just
the l part, right?

117
00:06:02,372 --> 00:06:03,830
I'm not going to
be able to change.

118
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,030
That's the way it works.

119
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,530
I'm not going to do
anything non-linear.

120
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,780
But the two things
I'm going to change

121
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:16,430
is this random
component, which is

122
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:21,410
that y, which used to be some
Gaussian with mean mu of x

123
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:24,200
here in sigma squared--

124
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,990
so y given x, sorry--

125
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:35,770
this is going to become y given
x follows some distribution.

126
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,690
And I'm not going to
allow any distribution.

127
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,900
I want something that comes
from the exponential family.

128
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,400
Who knows what the exponential
family of distribution is?

129
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,970
This is not the same thing as
the exponential distribution.

130
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,970
It's a family of distributions.

131
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,495
All right, so we'll see that.

132
00:07:00,495 --> 00:07:01,770
It's-- wow.

133
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,420
What can that be?

134
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,194
Oh yeah, that's
actually [INAUDIBLE]..

135
00:07:11,638 --> 00:07:17,050
So-- I'm sorry?

136
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,527
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

137
00:07:19,527 --> 00:07:21,360
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: I'm
in presentation mode.

138
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,650
That should not happen.

139
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,130
OK, so hopefully, this is muted.

140
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:32,300
So essentially, this is going
to be a family of distributions.

141
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,442
And what makes them
exponential typically

142
00:07:34,442 --> 00:07:35,900
is that there's an
exponential that

143
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,020
shows up in the definition
of the density, all right?

144
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,000
We'll see that the
Gaussian belongs

145
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,560
to the exponential family.

146
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,210
But they're slightly
less expected ones

147
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:48,570
because there's this crazy
thing that a to the x

148
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:52,327
is exponential x log a, which
makes the potential show up

149
00:07:52,327 --> 00:07:53,160
without being there.

150
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,910
So if there's an
exponential of some power,

151
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:55,830
it's going to show up.

152
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,640
But it's more than that.

153
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,639
So we'll actually come
to this particular family

154
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,866
of distribution.

155
00:07:59,866 --> 00:08:00,990
Why this particular family?

156
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,406
Because in a way,
everything we've

157
00:08:02,406 --> 00:08:04,710
done for the linear
model with Gaussian

158
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:08,610
is going to extend fairly
naturally to this family.

159
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,460
All right, and it actually
also, because it encompasses

160
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,470
pretty much everything,
all the distributions

161
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,950
we've discussed before.

162
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:19,890
All right, so the second thing
that I want to question--

163
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,260
right, so before,
we just said, well,

164
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:28,560
mu of x was directly
equal to this thing.

165
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,260
Mu of x was directly
x transpose beta.

166
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,530
So I knew I was going to
have an x transpose beta

167
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:39,030
and I said, well, I could do
something with this x transpose

168
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,750
beta before I used it to
explain the expected value.

169
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,490
But I'm actually
taking it like that.

170
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:52,200
Here, we're going to say, let's
extend this to some function

171
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,000
is equal to this thing.

172
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,790
Now admittedly, this is
not the most natural way

173
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,600
to think about it.

174
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,724
What you would probably
feel more comfortable doing

175
00:08:59,724 --> 00:09:03,870
is write something like
mu of x is a function.

176
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:08,070
Let's call it f of
x transpose beta.

177
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:12,850
But here, I decide
to call f g inverse.

178
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,574
OK, let's just my g inverse.

179
00:09:14,574 --> 00:09:15,074
Yes.

180
00:09:15,074 --> 00:09:18,430
AUDIENCE: Is this different
then just [INAUDIBLE]

181
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,430
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Yeah.

182
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:26,855
I mean, what transformation
you want to put on your x's?

183
00:09:26,855 --> 00:09:35,120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

184
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,620
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Oh
no, certainly not, right?

185
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,820
I mean, if I give you-- if I
force you to work with x1 plus

186
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,280
x2, you cannot work with
any function of x1 plus any

187
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,050
function of x2, right?

188
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,435
So this is different.

189
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,230
All right, so-- yeah.

190
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,900
The transformation would
be just the simple part

191
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,400
of your linear
regression problem

192
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,920
where you would take your
exes, transform them,

193
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,960
and then just apply
another linear regression.

194
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,950
This is genuinely new.

195
00:10:07,419 --> 00:10:08,210
Any other question?

196
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,740
All right, so this
function g and the reason

197
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,830
why I sort of have to, like,
stick to this slightly less

198
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,690
natural way of defining
it is because that's

199
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,660
g that gets a name, not g
inverse that gets a name.

200
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,330
And the name of g is
the link function.

201
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:33,530
So if I want to give you a
generalized linear model,

202
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,250
I need to give you
two ingredients.

203
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,630
The first one is the
random component,

204
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:40,110
which is the distribution
of y given x.

205
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:44,520
And it can be anything in what's
called the exponential family

206
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,630
of distributions.

207
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,670
So for example, I
could say, y given

208
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:50,910
x is Gaussian with mean
mu x sigma identity.

209
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,070
But I can also
tell you y given x

210
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:57,580
is gamma with shared parameter
equal to alpha of x, OK?

211
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,480
I could do some weird
things like this.

212
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,930
And the second thing is I need
to give you a link function.

213
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:08,300
And the link function is
going to become very clear

214
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,860
how you pick a link function.

215
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,350
And the only reason that you
actually pick a link function

216
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:15,010
is because of compatibility.

217
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:18,730
This mu of x, I call
it mu because mu of x

218
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,950
is always the conditional
expectation of y given x,

219
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:25,450
always, which means
that let's think

220
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,660
of y as being a Bernoulli
random variable.

221
00:11:31,176 --> 00:11:32,530
Where does mu of x live?

222
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

223
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,100
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: 0, 1, right?

224
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,683
That's the expectation
of a Bernoulli.

225
00:11:40,683 --> 00:11:43,630
It's just the probability
that my coin flip gives me 1.

226
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,630
So it's a number
between 0 and 1.

227
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:49,960
But this guy right here, if
my x's are anything, right--

228
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,540
think of any body
measurements plus [INAUDIBLE]

229
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,520
linear combinations with
arbitrarily large coefficients.

230
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,860
This thing can be
any real number.

231
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,180
So the link function, what
it's effectively going to do

232
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,060
is make those two
things compatible.

233
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,570
It's going to take
my number which,

234
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,270
for example, is constrained
to be between 0 and 1

235
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:11,006
and map it into the
entire real line.

236
00:12:11,006 --> 00:12:13,380
If I have mu which is forced
to be positive, for example,

237
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,830
in an exponential distribution,
the mean is positive, right?

238
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:20,850
That's the, say, don't
know, inter-arrival time

239
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,500
for Poisson process.

240
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,310
This thing is known to be
positive for an exponential.

241
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,060
I need to map something
that's exponential

242
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,072
to the entire real line.

243
00:12:28,072 --> 00:12:30,030
I need a function that
takes something positive

244
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,260
and [INAUDIBLE] everywhere.

245
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,520
So we'll see.

246
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,020
By the end of this
chapter, you will

247
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,900
have 100 ways of doing this, but
there are some more traditional

248
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,560
ones [INAUDIBLE].

249
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,110
So before we go any further,
I gave you the example

250
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:46,809
of a Bernoulli random variable.

251
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:48,850
Let's see a few examples
that actually fit there.

252
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:49,349
Yes.

253
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,509
AUDIENCE: Will it come up
later [INAUDIBLE] already know

254
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:56,154
why do we need the
transformer [INAUDIBLE] why

255
00:12:56,154 --> 00:12:59,300
don't [INAUDIBLE]

256
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,810
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
Well actually, this

257
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:02,830
will not come up later.

258
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,510
It should be very
clear from here

259
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,070
because if I actually
have a model,

260
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:08,290
I just want it to
be plausible, right?

261
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,040
I mean, what happens if I
suddenly decide that my--

262
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,669
so this is what's
going to happen.

263
00:13:12,669 --> 00:13:14,710
You're going to have only
data to fit this model.

264
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,530
Let's say you actually
forget about this thing here.

265
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,060
You can always do this, right?

266
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:23,974
You can always say I'm
going to pretend my y's just

267
00:13:23,974 --> 00:13:26,140
happen to be the realizations
of said Gaussians that

268
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,270
happen to be 0 or 1 only.

269
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:32,020
You can always, like, stuff that
in some linear model, right?

270
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,760
You will have some least
squares estimated for beta.

271
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,880
And it's going to be fine.

272
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,630
For all the points
that you see, it

273
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,270
will definitely put
some number that's

274
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,016
actually between 0 and 1.

275
00:13:42,016 --> 00:13:44,140
So this is what your picture
is going to look like.

276
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:48,795
You're going to have a
bunch of values for x.

277
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:50,169
This is your y.

278
00:13:50,169 --> 00:13:51,960
And for different-- so
these are the values

279
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,430
of x that you will get.

280
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,920
And for a y, you will see
either a 0 or a 1, right?

281
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,990
Right, that's what your
Bernoulli dataset would look

282
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,210
like with a one dimensional x.

283
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:09,680
Now if you do least squares
on this, you will find this.

284
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,360
And for this guy,
this line certainly

285
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,290
takes values between 0 and 1.

286
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,242
But let's say now
you get an x here.

287
00:14:16,242 --> 00:14:17,950
You're going to actually
start pretending

288
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:20,930
that the probability it spits
out one conditionally in x

289
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,910
is like 1.2, and that's
going to be weird.

290
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:31,240
Any other questions?

291
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,700
All right, so let's
start with some examples.

292
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,790
Right, I mean, you get so used
to them through this course.

293
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:41,250
So the first one is--

294
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,500
so all these things are taken.

295
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,124
So there's a few
books on generalizing,

296
00:14:44,124 --> 00:14:45,950
your models, generalize
[INAUDIBLE] models.

297
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,920
And there's tons of
applications that you can see.

298
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,990
Those are extremely
versatile, and as soon

299
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,775
as you want to do modeling
to explain some y given x,

300
00:14:53,775 --> 00:14:55,400
you sort of need to
do that if you want

301
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,040
to go beyond linear models.

302
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,610
So this was in the
disease occurring rate.

303
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:04,340
So you have a disease
epidemic and you

304
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:08,390
want to basically model
the expected number

305
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:11,390
of new cases given--

306
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,100
at a certain time, OK?

307
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,190
So you have time that progresses
for each of your reservation.

308
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,500
Each of your reservation
is a time stamp--

309
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,410
say, I don't know, 20th day.

310
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:26,354
And your response is
the number of new cases.

311
00:15:26,354 --> 00:15:28,520
And you're going to actually
put your model directly

312
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,480
on mu, right?

313
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,970
When I looked at
this, everything here

314
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,460
was on mu itself, on
the expected, right?

315
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,410
Mu of x is always the expected--

316
00:15:39,609 --> 00:15:42,230
the conditional
expectation of y given x.

317
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:45,890
right?

318
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:51,750
So all I need to model
is this expected value.

319
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,860
So this mu I'm going
to actually say--

320
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,620
so I look at some parameters,
and it says, well,

321
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,489
it increases exponentially.

322
00:16:00,489 --> 00:16:02,780
So I want to say I have some
sort of exponential trend.

323
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,820
I can parametrize
that in several ways.

324
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,500
And the two parameters
I want to slap in

325
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,190
is, like, some sort of gamma,
which is just the coefficient.

326
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:13,920
And then there's some rate
delta that's in the exponential.

327
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,650
So if I tell you
it's exponential,

328
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,330
that's a nice family
of functions you

329
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,710
might want to think about, OK?

330
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:24,520
So here, mu of x, if I want
to keep the notation, x

331
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:30,650
is gamma exponential
delta x, right?

332
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:34,600
Except that here, my x
are t1, t2, t3, et cetera.

333
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,340
And I want to find what the
parameters gamma and delta are

334
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,040
because I want to be
able to maybe compare

335
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,980
different epidemics and see if
they have the same parameter

336
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,670
or maybe just do some
prediction based on the data

337
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:49,070
that I have without-- to
extrapolate in the future.

338
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:58,280
So here, clearly mu of
x is not of the form

339
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,970
x transpose beta, right?

340
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,410
That's not x
transpose beta at all.

341
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:07,579
And it's actually not even a
function of x transpose data,

342
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:08,210
right?

343
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,900
There's two parameters,
gamma and delta,

344
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,849
and it's not of the form.

345
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:14,359
So here we have x,
which is 1 and x, right?

346
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:16,200
I have two parameters.

347
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,970
So what I do here
is that I say, well,

348
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,640
first, let me transform
mu in such a way

349
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,119
that I can hope to see
something that's linear.

350
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,819
So if I transform mu, I'm
going to have log of mu, which

351
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,099
is log of this thing, right?

352
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:33,770
So log of mu of
x is equal, well,

353
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,950
to log of gamma plus
log of exponential delta

354
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,350
x, which is delta x.

355
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:46,190
And now this thing is
actually linear in x.

356
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,440
So I have that this
guy is my first beta 1.

357
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,990
And so that's beta 1 finds 1.

358
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:53,320
And this guy is beta 2--

359
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,950
times, sorry that said beta
0-- times 1, and this guy

360
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,040
is beta 1 times x.

361
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,200
OK, so that looks
like a linear model.

362
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,330
I just have to change
my parameters--

363
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:05,840
my parameters beta 1 becomes
the log of gamma and beta 2

364
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,180
becomes delta itself.

365
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:11,210
And the reason why we do this
is because, well, the way

366
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,737
we put those gamma and those
delta was just so that we

367
00:18:13,737 --> 00:18:14,820
have some parametrization.

368
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,300
It just so happens that if
we want this to be linear,

369
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,052
we need to just change the
parametrization itself.

370
00:18:20,052 --> 00:18:21,510
This is going to
have some effects.

371
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,301
We know that it's going
to have some effect

372
00:18:23,301 --> 00:18:24,531
in the fissure information.

373
00:18:24,531 --> 00:18:27,030
It's going to have a bunch of
effect to change those things.

374
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,510
But that's what needs
to be done to have

375
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,240
a generalized linear model.

376
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,460
Now here, the
function that I took

377
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,690
to turn it into something
that's linear is simple.

378
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:41,000
It came directly from some
natural thing I would do here,

379
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,430
which is taking the log.

380
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,500
And so the function g,
the link that I take,

381
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,530
is called the log
link very creatively.

382
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,750
And it's just the
function that I

383
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,200
apply to mu so that I see
something that's linear

384
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,260
and that looks like this.

385
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:03,890
So now this only tells me how
to deal with the link function.

386
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:06,380
But I still have
to deal with 0.1.

387
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,960
And this, again, is
just some modeling.

388
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,090
Given some data,
some random data,

389
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:14,630
what distribution do you choose
to explain the randomness?

390
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:17,600
And this-- I mean,
unless there's no choice,

391
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,820
you know, it's just a
matter of practice, right?

392
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,100
I mean, why would it be
Gaussian and not, you know,

393
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,540
doubly exponential?

394
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,472
This is-- there's matters
of convenience that

395
00:19:25,472 --> 00:19:27,680
come into this, and there's
just matter of experience

396
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,780
that come into this.

397
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,660
You know, I remember when
you chat with engineers,

398
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,416
they have a very
good notion of what

399
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:35,540
the distribution should be.

400
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,970
They have y bold distributions.

401
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,909
You know, they do optics
and things like this.

402
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:42,450
So there's some distributions
that just come up but sometimes

403
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,640
just have to work.

404
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,380
Now here what do we have?

405
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,720
The thing we're
trying to measure, y--

406
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,790
as we said, so mu
is the expectation,

407
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,070
the conditional
expectation, of y given x.

408
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:56,090
But y is the number
of new cases, right?

409
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,560
Well it's a number of.

410
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,060
And the first thing
you should think

411
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,980
of when you think
about number of,

412
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,620
if it were bounded above, you
would think binomial, baby.

413
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,220
But here, it's just a number.

414
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,640
So you think Poisson.

415
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,750
That's how insurers think.

416
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:13,030
I have a number of, you
know, claims per year.

417
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:15,570
This is a Poisson distribution.

418
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:18,062
And hopefully they can model
the conditional distribution

419
00:20:18,062 --> 00:20:20,520
of the number of claims given
everything that they actually

420
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,940
ask you in the
surveys that I hear

421
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,980
you now fail in 15 minutes.

422
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:31,924
All right, so now you have
this Poisson distribution.

423
00:20:31,924 --> 00:20:33,590
And that's just the
modeling assumption.

424
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:34,840
There's no particular
reason why you

425
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,450
should do this except
that, you know,

426
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,050
that might be a good idea.

427
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,700
And the expected
value of your Poisson

428
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,915
has to be this mu i, OK?

429
00:20:42,915 --> 00:20:46,330
At time i.

430
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,760
Any question about this slide?

431
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,660
OK, so let's switch
to another example.

432
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,870
Another example is the
so-called pray capture rate.

433
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:58,010
So here, what
you're interested in

434
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:05,330
is the rate capture of
preys yi for a given prey.

435
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:10,730
And you have xy, which
is your explanation.

436
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,275
And this is just
the density of pray.

437
00:21:12,275 --> 00:21:17,030
So you're trying to explain the
rate of captures of preys given

438
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:20,060
the density of the prey, OK?

439
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,964
And so you need to find
some sort of relationship

440
00:21:22,964 --> 00:21:23,630
between the two.

441
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,250
And here again,
you talk to experts

442
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,570
and what they tell you
is that, well, it's

443
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:28,820
going to be increasing, right?

444
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,450
I mean, animals like predators
are going to just eat more

445
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:34,239
if there's more preys.

446
00:21:34,239 --> 00:21:35,780
But at some point,
they're just going

447
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,450
to level off because they're
going to be [INAUDIBLE] full

448
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:42,380
and they're going to stop
capturing those prays.

449
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,804
And you're just going to
have some phenomenon that

450
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:45,470
looks like this.

451
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,870
So here is a curve that
sort of makes sense, right?

452
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:52,130
As your capture rate goes from
0 to 1, you're increasing,

453
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,530
and then you see you have
this like [INAUDIBLE] function

454
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:57,630
that says, you know, at
some point it levels up.

455
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,490
OK, so here, one way I could--

456
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:01,590
I mean, there's again
many ways I could just

457
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,300
model a function
that looks like this.

458
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,910
But a simple one that
has only two parameters

459
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:09,930
is this one, where mu i is
this a function of xi where

460
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:13,230
I have some parameter alpha
here and some parameter h here.

461
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,820
OK, so there's clearly--

462
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:21,240
so this function, there's one
that essentially tells you--

463
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,880
so this thing starts
at 0 for sure.

464
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,770
And essentially,
alpha tells you how

465
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:28,170
sharp this thing
is, and h tells you

466
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:30,180
at which points you end here.

467
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,460
Well, it's not exactly what
those values are equal to,

468
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,380
but that tells you this.

469
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:41,329
OK, so, you know-- simple, and--

470
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:41,870
well, no, OK.

471
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:44,360
Sorry, that's actually alpha,
which is the maximum capture.

472
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,450
The rate and h represent
the pre-density

473
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:47,830
at which the capture weight is.

474
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,730
So that's the half time.

475
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:52,600
OK, so there's actual
value [INAUDIBLE]..

476
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,500
All right, so now I
have this function.

477
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,930
It's certainly not a function.

478
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:59,330
There's no-- I don't see
it as a function of x.

479
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:06,390
So I need to find something that
looks like a function of x, OK?

480
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,340
So then here, there's no log.

481
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:13,570
There's no-- well, I could
actually take a log here.

482
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,890
But I would have log of
x and log of x plus h.

483
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,600
So that would be weird.

484
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,990
So what we propose to
do here is to look,

485
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:23,350
rather than looking at mu
i, we look 1 over mu i.

486
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,890
Right, and so
since your function

487
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:37,450
was mu i, when you
take 1 over mu i,

488
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:42,580
you get h plus xi divided
by alpha xi, which

489
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:49,690
is h over alpha times one
over xi plus 1 over alpha.

490
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:52,320
And now if I'm willing to
make this transformation

491
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,330
of variables and say,
actually, I don't--

492
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:57,900
my x, whether it's
the density of prey

493
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,759
or the inverse density of
prey, it really doesn't matter.

494
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:02,300
I can always make
this transformation

495
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,750
when the data comes.

496
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,210
Then I'm actually just
going to think of this

497
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:11,400
as being some linear
function beta 0 plus beta 1,

498
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:17,345
which is this guy,
times 1 over xi.

499
00:24:17,345 --> 00:24:20,080
And now my new variable
becomes 1 over xi.

500
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,260
And now it's linear.

501
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,350
And the transformation
I had to take

502
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:34,240
was this 1 over x, which is
called the reciprocal link, OK?

503
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,120
You can probably guess what the
exponential link is going to be

504
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,453
and things like this, all right?

505
00:24:38,453 --> 00:24:41,380
So we'll talk about other
links that have slightly less

506
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,180
obvious names.

507
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,206
Now again, modeling, right?

508
00:24:45,206 --> 00:24:46,580
So this was the
random component.

509
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,690
This was the easy part.

510
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:50,920
Now I need to just poor
in some domain knowledge

511
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:55,900
about how do I think this
function, this y, which

512
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:01,810
is which is the rate
of capture of praise,

513
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:05,162
I want to understand how
this thing is actually

514
00:25:05,162 --> 00:25:09,430
changing what is the randomness
of the thing around its mean.

515
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,550
And you know, something
that-- so that

516
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,647
comes from this textbook.

517
00:25:12,647 --> 00:25:14,230
The standing deviation
of capture rate

518
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,750
might be approximately
proportional to the mean rate.

519
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,250
You need to find a
distribution that

520
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,390
actually has this property.

521
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,160
And it turns out
that this happens

522
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,950
for gamma distributions, right?

523
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:26,050
In gamma distributions,
just like say,

524
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:29,740
for Poisson distribution, the--

525
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,579
well, for Poisson, the variance
and mean are of the same order.

526
00:25:32,579 --> 00:25:34,120
Here is the standard
deviation that's

527
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:39,540
of the same order as the
[INAUDIBLE] for gammas.

528
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:42,300
And it's a positive
distribution as well.

529
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,790
So here is a candidate.

530
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,260
Now since we're
sort of constrained

531
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,777
to work under the exponential
family of distributions,

532
00:25:48,777 --> 00:25:50,360
then you can just
go through your list

533
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,430
and just decide which
one works best for you.

534
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,940
All right, third example--

535
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,270
so here we have binary response.

536
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:01,370
Here, essentially the
binary response variable

537
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:02,960
indicates the
presence or absence

538
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,460
of postoperative deforming
for kyphosis on children.

539
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:10,310
And here, rather than having
one covariance which was before,

540
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,950
in the first example, was
time, in the second example

541
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:15,230
was the density, here
there's three ways

542
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:17,030
that you measure on children.

543
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:19,510
The first one is
age of the child

544
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,440
and the second one is
the number of vertebrae

545
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,040
involved in the operation.

546
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,260
And the third one is
the start of the range,

547
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:29,660
right-- so where
it is on the spine.

548
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:35,105
OK, so the response
variable here is, you know,

549
00:26:35,105 --> 00:26:36,440
did it work or not, right?

550
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,970
I mean, that's very simple.

551
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:41,859
And so here, it's nice
because the random component

552
00:26:41,859 --> 00:26:42,650
is the easiest one.

553
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:45,680
As I said, any random variable
that takes only two outcomes

554
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,020
must be a Bernoulli, right?

555
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,004
So that's nice there's no
modeling going on here.

556
00:26:52,004 --> 00:26:54,170
So you know that y given x
is going to be Bernoulli,

557
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:55,628
but of course, all
your efforts are

558
00:26:55,628 --> 00:26:58,190
going to try to understand
what the conditional mean

559
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,315
of your Bernoulli, what
the conditional probability

560
00:27:00,315 --> 00:27:02,090
of being 1 is going to be, OK?

561
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:05,960
And so in particular--
so I'm just-- here,

562
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,990
I'm spelling it out before
we close those examples.

563
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:12,560
I cannot say that mu of x is x
transpose data for exactly this

564
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,520
picture that I drew
for you here, right?

565
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,500
There's just no
way here-- the goal

566
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,050
of doing this is certainly
to be able to extrapolate

567
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:23,650
for yet unseen children
whether this is something

568
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:24,850
that we should be doing.

569
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:27,340
And maybe the range
of x is actually

570
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,480
going to be slightly out.

571
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,550
And so, OK I don't
want to see that have

572
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:34,770
a negative probability of
outcome or a positive one--

573
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:38,590
sorry, or one that's
lower than one.

574
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,970
So I need to make
this transformation.

575
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:43,700
So what I need to do is
to transform mu, which

576
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,930
is, we know only a number.

577
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,880
All we know is a
number between 0 and 1.

578
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,590
And we need to transform
it in such a way

579
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:50,510
that it maps the
entire real line

580
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:57,270
or reciprocally to say that--

581
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,850
or inversely, I should say--

582
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:00,650
that f of x
transpose beta should

583
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:02,410
be a number between 0 and 1.

584
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:05,000
I need to find a function
that takes any real number

585
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,950
and maps it into 0 and 1.

586
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:10,460
And we'll see that
again, but you

587
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,480
have an army of functions
that do that for you.

588
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,761
What are those functions?

589
00:28:16,707 --> 00:28:17,689
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

590
00:28:17,689 --> 00:28:19,162
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: I'm sorry?

591
00:28:19,162 --> 00:28:20,085
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

592
00:28:20,085 --> 00:28:21,126
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Trait?

593
00:28:21,126 --> 00:28:22,665
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

594
00:28:22,665 --> 00:28:23,581
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Oh.

595
00:28:23,581 --> 00:28:25,518
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

596
00:28:25,518 --> 00:28:28,059
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Yeah, I want
them to be invertible, right?

597
00:28:28,059 --> 00:28:34,074
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

598
00:28:34,074 --> 00:28:35,990
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: I
have an army of function.

599
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:39,100
I'm not asking for one
soldier in this army.

600
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,860
I want the name of this army.

601
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:44,057
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

602
00:28:44,057 --> 00:28:46,640
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Well, they're
not really invertible either,

603
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,860
right?

604
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:53,730
So they're actually in
[INAUDIBLE] textbook.

605
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:55,272
Because remember,
statisticians don't

606
00:28:55,272 --> 00:28:56,980
know how to integrate
functions, but they

607
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:59,250
know how to turn a function
into a Gaussian integral.

608
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,722
So we know it integrates
to 1 and things like this.

609
00:29:01,722 --> 00:29:03,180
Same thing here--
we don't know how

610
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:06,692
to build functions that
are invertible and map

611
00:29:06,692 --> 00:29:08,400
the entire real line
to 0, 1, but there's

612
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,350
all the cumulative distribution
functions that do that for us.

613
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,190
So I can you any of
those guys, and that's

614
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:16,330
what I'm going to
be doing, actually.

615
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:19,730
All right, so just
to recap what I just

616
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:23,870
said as we were speaking, so
normal linear model is not

617
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:30,470
appropriate for these examples
if only because the response

618
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:34,340
variable is not
necessarily Gaussian

619
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:37,430
and also because the
linear model has to be--

620
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:39,600
the mean has to be transformed
before I can actually

621
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,210
apply a linear model for all
these plausible nonlinear

622
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:44,890
models that I
actually came up with.

623
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:48,080
OK, so the family
we're going to go for

624
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,780
is the exponential
family of distributions.

625
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:54,130
And we're going to
be able to show--

626
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:56,120
so one of the nice
part of this is

627
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,300
to actually compute
maximum likelihood

628
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,570
estimaters for those right?

629
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:02,390
In the linear model,
maximum-- like, in the Gauss

630
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:05,360
linear model, maximum likelihood
was as nice as it gets, right?

631
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,810
This actually was the
least squares estimator.

632
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,220
We had a close form.

633
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,920
x transpose x inverse
x transpose y,

634
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,120
and that was it, OK?

635
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,780
We had to just take
one derivative.

636
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:19,580
Here, we're going to have a
generally concave likelihood.

637
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,170
We're not going to
be able to actually

638
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:23,750
solve this thing
directly in close form

639
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:26,610
unless it's Gaussian,
but we will have--

640
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:30,070
we'll see actually
how this is not just

641
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:32,770
a black box optimization
of a concave function.

642
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:35,830
We have a lot of properties
of this concave function,

643
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:38,500
and we will be able to show
some iterative algorithms.

644
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:42,880
We'll basically see how, when
you opened the box of convex

645
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,270
optimization, you will actually
be able to see how things work

646
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:49,070
and actually implement
it using least squares.

647
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:51,260
So each iteration of
this iterative algorithm

648
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,760
will essentially
be a least squares,

649
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,700
and that's actually
quite [INAUDIBLE]..

650
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,830
So, very demonstrative
of statisticians

651
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:59,770
being pretty
ingenious so that they

652
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,900
don't have to call in
some statistical software

653
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:06,040
but just can repeatedly
call their least squares

654
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,730
Oracle within a
statistical software.

655
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:12,170
OK, so what is the
exponential family, right?

656
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,390
I promised to do the
exponential family.

657
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:17,540
Before we go into
this, let me just

658
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,910
tell you something about
exponential families,

659
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:22,040
and what's the only
thing to differentiate

660
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,870
an exponential family from
all possible distributions?

661
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:28,640
An exponential family has
two parameters, right?

662
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,140
And those are not
really parameters,

663
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:33,530
but there's this theta parameter
of my distribution, OK?

664
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:35,450
So it's going to be
indexed by some parameter.

665
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:37,324
Here, I'm only talking
about the distribution

666
00:31:37,324 --> 00:31:40,550
of, say, some random variable
or some random vector, OK?

667
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:44,360
So here in this slide, you see
that the parameter theta that

668
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:48,760
indexed those distribution
is k dimensional

669
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:53,840
and the space of the x's
that I'm looking at-- so

670
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,735
that should really be y, right?

671
00:31:55,735 --> 00:31:57,110
What I'm going to
plug in here is

672
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:59,570
the conditional distribution
of y given x and theta is

673
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:00,620
going to depend on x.

674
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,110
But this really is the y.

675
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:04,770
That's their distribution
of the response variable.

676
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,620
And so this is on q, right?

677
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:09,250
So I'm going to
assume that y takes--

678
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:12,200
q dimensional--
is q dimensional.

679
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,270
Clearly soon, q is
going to be equal to 1,

680
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:16,340
but I can define those
things generally.

681
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,750
OK, so I have this.

682
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,710
I have to tell you
what this looks like.

683
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:23,310
And let's assume that this is
a probability density function.

684
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:26,360
So this, right this notation,
the fact that I just

685
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,490
put my theta in
subscript, is just

686
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:31,400
for me to remember that
this is the variable that

687
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,160
indicates the random variable,
and this is just the parameter.

688
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,400
But I could just write it as a
function of theta and x, right?

689
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,650
This is just going to be--
right, if you were in calc,

690
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,360
in multivariable
calc, you would have

691
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,110
two parameter of theta
and x and you would

692
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:45,320
need to give me a function.

693
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,580
Now think of all--

694
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:50,360
think of x and theta as being
one dimensional at this point.

695
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,890
Think of all the
functions that can

696
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:54,530
be depending on theta and x.

697
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:56,660
There's many of them.

698
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:01,810
And in particular, there's many
ways theta and x can interact.

699
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:03,580
What the exponential
family does for you

700
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,860
is that it restricts
the way these things

701
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,877
can actually interact
with each other.

702
00:33:07,877 --> 00:33:09,460
It's essentially
saying the following.

703
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:15,700
It's saying this is going to
be of the form exponential--

704
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,100
so this exponential is
really not much because I

705
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,020
could put a log next to it.

706
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:24,940
But what I want is that
the way theta and x

707
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:30,310
interact has to be of
the form theta times x

708
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:32,530
in an exponential, OK?

709
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:34,210
So that's the
simplest-- that's one

710
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:36,585
of the ways you can think of
them interacting is you just

711
00:33:36,585 --> 00:33:37,900
the product of the two.

712
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,450
Now clearly, this is
not a very rich family.

713
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:43,090
So what I'm allowing
myself is to just slap

714
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:46,000
on some terms that depend only
on theta and depend only on x.

715
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,630
So let's just call this thing, I
don't know, f of x, g of theta.

716
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:56,649
OK, so here, I've restricted the
way theta and x can interact.

717
00:33:56,649 --> 00:33:58,190
So I have something
that depends only

718
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,981
on x, something that
depends only on theta.

719
00:33:59,981 --> 00:34:02,560
And here, I have this
very specific interaction.

720
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:06,310
And that's all that exponential
families are doing for you, OK?

721
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:09,840
So if we go back to this slide,
this is much more general,

722
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:14,770
right? if I want to go from
theta and x in r to theta

723
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:16,270
and x theta in r--

724
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:26,659
to theta in r k and x in rq,
I cannot take the product

725
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:27,386
of theta and x.

726
00:34:27,386 --> 00:34:29,719
I cannot even take the inner
product between theta and x

727
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:32,030
because they're not even
of compatible dimensions.

728
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:37,460
But what I can do is to first
map my theta into something

729
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,940
and map my x into something
so that I actually end up

730
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,080
having the same dimensions.

731
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,550
And then I can take
the inner product.

732
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,900
That's the natural
generalization

733
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,858
of this simple product.

734
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,340
OK, so what I have is--

735
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,230
right, so if I want
to go from theta

736
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:10,510
to x, when I'm going to first
do is I'm going to take theta,

737
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,710
eta of theta--

738
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:16,590
so let's say eta1 of
theta to eta k of theta.

739
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,220
And then I'm going
to actually take

740
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:29,994
x becomes t1 of x all
the way to tk of x.

741
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:32,160
And what I'm going to do
is take the inner product--

742
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,540
so let's call this eta
and let's call this t.

743
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:39,710
And I'm going to take the inner
product of eta and t, which

744
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:49,550
is just the sum from j equal
1 to k of eta j of theta times

745
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:52,770
tj of x.

746
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:57,690
OK, so that's just a way to say
I want this simple interaction

747
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:58,690
but in higher dimension.

748
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,900
The simplest way I can actually
make those things happen

749
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,233
is just by taking inner product.

750
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:07,010
OK, and so now what
it's telling me

751
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:09,630
is that the distribution-- so
I want the exponential times

752
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,921
something that depends only
on theta and something that

753
00:36:11,921 --> 00:36:12,990
depends only on x.

754
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,490
And so what it tells
me is that when

755
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:16,200
I'm going to take
p of theta x, it's

756
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,640
just going to be something
which is exponential

757
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:30,225
times the sum from j equal 1
to k of eta j theta tj of x.

758
00:36:30,225 --> 00:36:32,600
And then I'm going to have a
function that depends only--

759
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:36,040
so let me read it for now
like c of theta and then

760
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,610
a function that
depends only on x.

761
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:39,490
Let me call it h of x.

762
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:42,340
And for convenience,
there's no particular reason

763
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,300
why I do that.

764
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,220
I'm taking this
function c of theta

765
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,300
and I'm just actually
pushing it in there.

766
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:57,182
So I can write c of theta as
exponential minus log of 1

767
00:36:57,182 --> 00:36:58,612
over c of theta, right?

768
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:03,324
And now I have exponential
times exponential.

769
00:37:03,324 --> 00:37:04,990
So I push it in, and
this thing actually

770
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:10,320
looks like exponential sum
from j equal 1 to k of eta

771
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:22,120
j theta tj of x minus log 1
over c of theta times h of x.

772
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:26,030
And this thing here, log 1 over
c of theta, I call actually

773
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:32,060
b of theta Because
c, I called it c.

774
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:35,140
But I can actually
directly call this guy b,

775
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:38,160
and I don't actually
care about c itself.

776
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:43,900
Now why don't I put back
also h of x in there?

777
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:48,949
Because h of x is
really here to just--

778
00:37:48,949 --> 00:37:50,398
how to put it--

779
00:37:54,262 --> 00:38:00,160
OK, h of x and b of theta
don't play the same role.

780
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,490
B of theta in many ways is a
normalizing constant, right?

781
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:06,820
I want this density
to integrate to 1.

782
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,520
If I did not have
this guy, I'm not

783
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,950
guaranteed that this
thing integrates to 1.

784
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:14,860
But by tweaking this function
b of theta or c of theta--

785
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,080
they're equivalent--

786
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,350
I can actually ensure that
this thing integrates to 1.

787
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:22,834
So b of theta is just
a normalizing constant.

788
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:25,000
H of x is something that's
going to be funny for us.

789
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,583
It's going to be
something that allows

790
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:29,740
us to be able to treat both
discrete and continuous

791
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:38,140
variables within the framework
of exponential families.

792
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,060
So for those that are
familiar with this,

793
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,890
this is essentially
saying that that h of x

794
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:44,120
is really just a
change of measure.

795
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:48,370
When I actually look at
the density of p of theta--

796
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:50,320
this is with respect
to some measure--

797
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,810
the fact that I just multiplied
by a function of x just

798
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:53,990
means that I'm not looking--

799
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:56,420
that this guy here
without h of theta

800
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,390
is not the density with respect
to the original measure,

801
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:01,660
but it's the density with
respect to the distribution

802
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:04,272
that has h as a density.

803
00:39:04,272 --> 00:39:05,480
That's all I'm saying, right?

804
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,650
So I can first transform my
x's and then take the density

805
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,300
with respect to that.

806
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,851
If you don't want to think
about densities or measures,

807
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:13,600
you don't have to.

808
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,790
This is just the way--

809
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,930
this is just the definition.

810
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:19,610
Is there any question
about this definition?

811
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,290
All right, so it
looks complicated,

812
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:23,560
but it's actually
essentially the simplest

813
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,360
way you could think about it.

814
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:29,004
You want to be able to
have x and theta interact

815
00:39:29,004 --> 00:39:30,670
and you just say, I
want the interaction

816
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:34,126
to be of the form
exponential x times theta.

817
00:39:34,126 --> 00:39:35,500
And if they're
higher dimensions,

818
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,530
I'm going to take
the exponential

819
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:38,203
of the function
of x inner product

820
00:39:38,203 --> 00:39:39,244
with a function of theta.

821
00:39:43,749 --> 00:39:45,540
All right, so I claimed
since the beginning

822
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,167
that the Gaussian
was such an example.

823
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:48,000
So let's just do it.

824
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,330
So is the Gaussian of the-- is
the interaction between theta

825
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:55,350
and x in a Gaussian of
the form in the product?

826
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:58,680
And the answer is yes.

827
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:03,480
Actually, whether I know or
not what the variance is, OK?

828
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,747
So let's start for the case
where I actually do not

829
00:40:06,747 --> 00:40:07,830
know what the variance is.

830
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:13,500
So here, I have x is
n mu sigma squared.

831
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,804
This is all one dimensional.

832
00:40:14,804 --> 00:40:17,220
And here, I'm going to assume
that my parameter is both mu

833
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,440
and sigma square.

834
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,135
OK, so what I need to do is
to have some function of mu,

835
00:40:22,135 --> 00:40:24,510
some function of stigma square,
and take an inner product

836
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:26,635
of some function of x and
some other function of x.

837
00:40:26,635 --> 00:40:29,060
So I want to show that--

838
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:32,350
so p theta of x is what?

839
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:36,390
Well, it's one over
square root sigma 2 pi

840
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:42,280
exponential minus x minus mu
squared over 2 sigma squared,

841
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,370
right?

842
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:45,840
So that's just my
Gaussian density.

843
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:49,410
And I want to say that
this thing here-- so

844
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:51,660
clearly, the exponential
shows up already.

845
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,970
I want to show that this
is something that looks

846
00:40:53,970 --> 00:41:01,620
like, you know, eta 1 of--

847
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:08,395
sorry, so that was-- yeah, eta
1 of, say, mu sigma squared.

848
00:41:08,395 --> 00:41:09,770
So I have only
two of those guys,

849
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,780
so I'm going to need
only two etas, right?

850
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:16,030
So I want it to be eta 1
of mu and sigma times t1

851
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:22,940
of x plus eta 2 mu 1 mu sigma
squared times t2 of x, right?

852
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:26,070
So I want to have something
like that that shows up,

853
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,830
and the only things
that are left,

854
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:32,250
I want them to depend either
only on theta or only on x.

855
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:37,500
So to find that out,
we just need to expand.

856
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:42,480
OK, so I'm going to first put
everything into my exponential

857
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,650
and expand this guy.

858
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:46,110
So the first term here
is going to be minus x

859
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,876
squared over 2 sigma square.

860
00:41:47,876 --> 00:41:49,500
The second term is
going to be minus mu

861
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,150
squared over two sigma squared.

862
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:55,650
And then the cross term is
going to be plus x mu divided

863
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:57,014
by sigma squared.

864
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,680
And then I'm going
to put this guy here.

865
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:05,037
So I have a minus log
sigma over 2 pi, OK?

866
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:13,740
OK, is this-- so this term
here contains an interaction

867
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,510
between X and the parameters.

868
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:17,250
This term here
contains an interaction

869
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:18,480
between X and the parameters.

870
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,240
So let me try to write
them in a way that I want.

871
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,950
This guy only depends
on the parameters,

872
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:25,870
this guy only depends
on the parameter.

873
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:28,390
So I'm going to
rearrange things.

874
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:34,080
And so I claim that this
is of the form x squared.

875
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,369
Well, let's say-- do--

876
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:44,800
who's getting the minus?

877
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,180
Eta, OK.

878
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:52,960
So it's x squared times
minus 1 over 2 sigma

879
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:58,450
squared plus x times mu
over sigma squared, right?

880
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,630
So that's this term here.

881
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:01,060
That's this term here.

882
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:04,129
Now I need to get this guy
here, and that's minus.

883
00:43:04,129 --> 00:43:05,920
So I'm going to write
it like this-- minus,

884
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,950
and now I have mu
squared over 2 sigma

885
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:15,648
squared plus log sigma
square root 2 pi.

886
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:31,430
And now this thing is definitely
of the form t of x times--

887
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:34,020
did I call them the
right way or not?

888
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:36,490
Of course not.

889
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:39,450
OK, so that's going to
be t2 of x times eta

890
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,820
2 of x eta 2 of theta.

891
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:48,230
This guy is going to be t1
of x times eta 1 of theta.

892
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:50,992
All right, so just a function
of theta times a function of x--

893
00:43:50,992 --> 00:43:52,950
just a function of theta
times a function of x.

894
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:55,680
And the way combined is
just by sending them.

895
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,690
And this is going
to be my d of theta.

896
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:04,700
What is h of x?

897
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,145
AUDIENCE: 1.

898
00:44:06,145 --> 00:44:07,020
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: 1.

899
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:09,800
There's one thing I
can actually play with,

900
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,040
and this is something you're
going to have some three

901
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,090
choices, right?

902
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:19,850
This is not actually completely
determined here is that--

903
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:27,220
for example, so when I write
the log sigma square root 2 pi,

904
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:32,660
this is just log of sigma
plus log square root 2 pi.

905
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:34,270
So I have two choices here.

906
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:37,670
Either my b becomes
this guy, or--

907
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:41,150
so either I have
b of theta, which

908
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:45,320
is mu squared over 2 sigma
squared plus log sigma

909
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:51,920
square root 2 pi and h of
x is equal to 1, or I have

910
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:56,120
that b of theta is mu
square over 2 sigma squared

911
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,120
plus log sigma.

912
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,750
And h of x is equal to what?

913
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,300
Well, I can just push
this guy out, right?

914
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,160
I can push it out
of the exponential.

915
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,370
And so it's just square
root of 2 pi, which is

916
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:16,590
a function of x, technically.

917
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:19,760
I mean, it's a constant function
of x, but it's a function.

918
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,420
So you can see that it's
not completely clear

919
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:25,090
how you're going to do
the trade off, right?

920
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:28,840
So the constant terms can
go either in b or in h.

921
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:33,660
But you know, why bother with
tracking down b and h when

922
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:35,410
you can actually stuff
everything into one

923
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:38,200
and just call h one
and call it a day?

924
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,770
Right, so you can
just forget about h.

925
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:43,790
You know it's one and
think about the right.

926
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:46,410
H won't matter actually for
estimation purposes or anything

927
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,386
like this.

928
00:45:48,386 --> 00:45:50,760
All right, so that's basically
everything that's written.

929
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:55,040
When stigma square
is known, what's

930
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:00,020
happening is that this
guy here is no longer

931
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:03,640
a function of theta, right?

932
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,401
Agreed?

933
00:46:05,401 --> 00:46:06,650
This is no longer a parameter.

934
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:14,990
When sigma square is known,
then theta is equal to mu only.

935
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:17,660
There's no sigma
square going on.

936
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:19,657
So this-- everything
depends on sigma square

937
00:46:19,657 --> 00:46:20,990
can be thought of as a constant.

938
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:23,010
Think one.

939
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:26,910
So in particular, this
term here does not

940
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:30,270
belong in the interaction
between x and theta.

941
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:37,150
It belongs to h, right?

942
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:49,120
So if sigma is known, then this
guy is only a function of h--

943
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,770
of x.

944
00:46:50,770 --> 00:47:01,420
So h of x becomes exponential
x squared minus x squared

945
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:05,674
over 2 sigma squared, right?

946
00:47:05,674 --> 00:47:06,840
That's just a function of x.

947
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:11,681
Is that clear?

948
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,650
So if you complete this
computation, what you're

949
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:28,402
going to get is that your new
one parameter thing is that p

950
00:47:28,402 --> 00:47:35,760
theta x is not equal to
exponential x times mu

951
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,227
over sigma squared minus--

952
00:47:39,227 --> 00:47:40,560
well, it's still the same thing.

953
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,390
And then you have your
h of x that comes out--

954
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:58,370
x squared over 2 sigma squared.

955
00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:02,350
OK, so that's my h of x.

956
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:05,960
That's still my b of theta.

957
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:11,260
And this is my t1 of x.

958
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:15,190
And this is my eta one of theta.

959
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:18,060
And remember, theta is just
equal to mu in this case.

960
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:26,610
So if I ask you prove that
this distribution belongs

961
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:29,390
to an exponential family,
you just have to work it out.

962
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:32,480
Typically, it's expanding what's
in the exponential and see

963
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,180
what's--

964
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:35,690
and just write it in
this term and identify

965
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:36,890
all the components, right?

966
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:39,576
So here, notice those guys
don't even get an index anymore

967
00:48:39,576 --> 00:48:40,950
because there's
just one of them.

968
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:45,629
So I wrote eta 1 and t1, but
it's really just eta and t.

969
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:54,410
Oh sorry, this guy also goes.

970
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:56,240
This is also a constant, right?

971
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:01,240
So it can actually
just put sigma divided

972
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,390
by sigma square root 2 pi.

973
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:04,790
So h of x is what, actually?

974
00:49:08,718 --> 00:49:12,155
Is it the density of--

975
00:49:12,155 --> 00:49:13,630
AUDIENCE: Standard [INAUDIBLE].

976
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:14,350
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
It's not standard.

977
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:15,340
It's centered.

978
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:16,330
It has mean 0.

979
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:18,810
But it variance
sigma squared, right?

980
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:21,060
But it's the density
of a Gaussian.

981
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:23,620
And this is what I
meant when I said

982
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:27,280
h of x is really just telling
you with respect to which

983
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,920
distribution, which measure
you're taking the density.

984
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,310
And so this thing here
is really telling you

985
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:37,690
the density of my
Gaussian with mean mu

986
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:41,710
is equal to-- is this with
respect to a centered Gaussian

987
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:43,636
is this guy, right?

988
00:49:43,636 --> 00:49:44,510
That's what it means.

989
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:46,310
If this thing ends
up being a density,

990
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:49,370
it just means that now you
just have a new measure, which

991
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:51,270
is this density.

992
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:53,270
So it's just saying
that the density

993
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:57,560
of the Gaussian with
mean mu with respect

994
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,928
to the Gaussian with mean 0
is just this [INAUDIBLE] here.

995
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:07,960
All right, so let's move on.

996
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:11,050
So here, as I said,
you could actually

997
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:13,840
do all these computations
and forget about the fact

998
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,430
that x is continuous.

999
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:20,690
You can actually do it with PMFs
and do it for x is discrete.

1000
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:23,540
This actually also tells
you if you can actually

1001
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:26,540
get the same form for
your density, which

1002
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:29,000
is of the form exponential
times the product

1003
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,060
of the the interaction
between theta

1004
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:34,010
and x is just
taking this product,

1005
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:36,950
then a function only of theta
and of function only of x,

1006
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:40,130
for the PMF, it also works.

1007
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:42,050
OK, so I claim
that the Bernoulli

1008
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:44,960
belongs to this family.

1009
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,380
So the PMF of a Bernoulli--

1010
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:54,590
we say parameter p is p to the
x 1 minus p to the 1 minus x,

1011
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:55,540
right?

1012
00:50:55,540 --> 00:51:00,440
Because we know so that's
only for x equals 0 or 1.

1013
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:03,160
And the reason is because
when x is equal to 0,

1014
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,060
this is 1 minus p.

1015
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:06,627
When x is equal to
1, this is minus 0.

1016
00:51:06,627 --> 00:51:08,210
OK, we've seen that
when we're looking

1017
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:11,730
at likelihoods for Bernoullis.

1018
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:16,700
OK, this is not clear this is
going to look like this at all.

1019
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,610
But let's do it.

1020
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:21,660
OK, so what does
this thing look like?

1021
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:23,150
Well, the first
thing I want to do

1022
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:24,710
is to make an
exponential show up.

1023
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:26,084
So what I'm going
to write is I'm

1024
00:51:26,084 --> 00:51:31,190
going to write p to the x as
exponential x log p, right?

1025
00:51:33,714 --> 00:51:35,630
And so I'm going to do
that for the other one.

1026
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:37,690
So this thing here--

1027
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:43,090
so I'm going to get
exponential x log

1028
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:47,038
p plus 1 minus x log 1 minus p.

1029
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:54,050
So what I need to do is
to collect my terms in x

1030
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:56,750
and my terms in whatever
parameters I have,

1031
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:59,080
see here if theta is equal to p.

1032
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:05,170
So if I do this,
what I end up having

1033
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:08,440
is equal to exponential--

1034
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:12,650
so determine x is log
p minus log 1 minus p.

1035
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:18,140
So that's x times
log p over 1 minus p.

1036
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:20,050
And then the term
that rest is just--

1037
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:23,276
that stays is just 1
times log 1 minus p.

1038
00:52:23,276 --> 00:52:25,400
But I want to see this as
a minus something, right?

1039
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,067
It was minus b of theta.

1040
00:52:27,067 --> 00:52:28,525
So I'm going to
write it as minus--

1041
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:35,150
well, I can just keep the
plus, and I'm going to do--

1042
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:44,362
and that's all [INAUDIBLE].

1043
00:52:44,362 --> 00:52:46,340
A-ha!

1044
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:48,060
Well, this is of the
form exponential--

1045
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:50,940
something that depends only on
x times something that depends

1046
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:52,720
only on theta--

1047
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,000
minus a function that
depends only on theta.

1048
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,230
And then h of x is
equal to 1 again.

1049
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:00,630
OK, so let's see.

1050
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:03,410
So I have t1 of x is equal to x.

1051
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:04,880
That's this guy.

1052
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:11,000
Eta 1 of theta is equal
to log p1 minus p.

1053
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:20,930
And b of theta is equal to
log 1 over 1 minus p, OK?

1054
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:26,470
And h of x is equal
to 1, all right?

1055
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:31,230
You guys want to do
Poisson, or do you

1056
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:32,313
want to have any homework?

1057
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,670
It's a dilemma because that's
an easy homework versus

1058
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:41,410
no homework at all but maybe
something more difficult. OK,

1059
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:43,680
who wants to do it now?

1060
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,331
Who does not want to
raise their hand now?

1061
00:53:46,331 --> 00:53:47,747
Who wants to raise
their hand now?

1062
00:53:47,747 --> 00:53:57,116
All right, so let's move on.

1063
00:53:57,116 --> 00:53:59,240
I'll just do-- do you want
to do the gammas instead

1064
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,080
in the homework?

1065
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,150
That's going to be fun.

1066
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:04,450
I'm not even going to
propose to do the gammas.

1067
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:08,570
And so this is the
gamma distribution.

1068
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:10,820
It's brilliantly
called gamma because it

1069
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:14,480
has the gamma function just
like the beta distribution had

1070
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,400
the beta function in there.

1071
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,690
They look very similar.

1072
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:20,960
One is defined over r plus,
the positive real line.

1073
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,650
And remember, the beta was
defined over the interval 0, 1.

1074
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:28,640
And it's of the form x to
some power times exponential

1075
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,980
of minus x to some--

1076
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,340
times something, right?

1077
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:34,298
So there's a function of
polynomial [INAUDIBLE]

1078
00:54:34,298 --> 00:54:38,004
x where the exponent
depends on the parameter.

1079
00:54:38,004 --> 00:54:40,670
And then there's the exponential
minus x times something depends

1080
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:41,930
on the parameters.

1081
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:47,921
So this is going to also look
like some function of x--

1082
00:54:47,921 --> 00:54:49,670
sorry, like some
exponential distribution.

1083
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:52,280
Can somebody guess what
is going to be t2 of x?

1084
00:54:58,338 --> 00:55:01,251
Oh, those are the functions of
x that show up in this product,

1085
00:55:01,251 --> 00:55:01,750
right?

1086
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:03,462
Remember when we have this--

1087
00:55:03,462 --> 00:55:05,170
we just need to take
some transformations

1088
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:08,870
of x so it looks linear in those
things and not in x itself.

1089
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:11,570
Remember, we had x squared
and x, for example,

1090
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:12,560
in the Gaussian case.

1091
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,471
I don't know if
it's still there.

1092
00:55:14,471 --> 00:55:15,720
Yeah, it's still there, right?

1093
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,330
t2 was x squared.

1094
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:20,540
What do you think x is
going-- t2 of x here.

1095
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:23,536
So here's a hint.
t1 is going to be x.

1096
00:55:23,536 --> 00:55:24,410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1097
00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:25,480
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE],,

1098
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:26,438
what is going to be t1?

1099
00:55:26,438 --> 00:55:27,890
Yeah, you can--
this one is taken.

1100
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:28,690
This one is taken.

1101
00:55:31,313 --> 00:55:32,580
What?

1102
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:33,700
Log x, right?

1103
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:35,680
Because this x to
the a minus 1, I'm

1104
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:39,380
going to write that as
exponential a minus 1 log x.

1105
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:43,375
So basically, eta 1 is
going to be a minus 1.

1106
00:55:43,375 --> 00:55:47,560
Eta 2 is going to
be minus 1 over b--

1107
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:48,980
well, actually the opposite.

1108
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:50,271
And then you're going to have--

1109
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:52,630
but this is actually
not too complicated.

1110
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:55,090
All right, then those
parameters get names.

1111
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:58,480
a is the shape parameter,
b is the scale parameter.

1112
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,280
It doesn't really matter.

1113
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,710
You have other things that
are called the inverse gamma

1114
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:05,850
distribution, which
has this form.

1115
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:09,360
The difference is that
the parameter alpha

1116
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:14,700
shows negatively there and
then the inverse Gaussian

1117
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:15,480
distribution.

1118
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:20,220
You know, just densities
you can come up with

1119
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:23,305
and they just happened
to fall in this family.

1120
00:56:23,305 --> 00:56:25,680
And there's other ones that
you can actually put in there

1121
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:26,640
that we've seen before.

1122
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,695
The chi-square is actually
part of this family.

1123
00:56:28,695 --> 00:56:30,570
The beta distribution
is part of this family.

1124
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:32,611
The binomial distribution
is part of this family.

1125
00:56:32,611 --> 00:56:35,030
Well, that's easy because
the Bernoulli was.

1126
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:39,390
The negative binomial, which
is some stopping time--

1127
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:42,600
the first time you hit a
certain number of successes

1128
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:46,120
when you flip some
Bernoulli coins.

1129
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,665
So you can check
for all of those,

1130
00:56:47,665 --> 00:56:50,040
and you will see that you can
actually write them as part

1131
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,510
of the exponential family.

1132
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:53,040
So the main goal
of this slide is

1133
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,581
to convince you that
this is actually

1134
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:56,400
a pretty broad range
of distributions

1135
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,360
because it basically includes
everything we've seen

1136
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:03,540
but not anything there--

1137
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:06,540
sorry, plus more, OK?

1138
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:07,040
Yeah.

1139
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,040
AUDIENCE: Is there any
example of a distribution

1140
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,456
that comes up
pretty often that's

1141
00:57:10,456 --> 00:57:11,801
not in the exponential family?

1142
00:57:11,801 --> 00:57:13,384
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
Yeah, like uniform.

1143
00:57:13,384 --> 00:57:16,312
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK, so maybe
a bit more complicated than

1144
00:57:16,312 --> 00:57:17,702
[INAUDIBLE].

1145
00:57:17,702 --> 00:57:19,410
Anything Anything that
has a support that

1146
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:21,740
depends on the parameter
is not going to fall--

1147
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:24,410
is not going to fit in there.

1148
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:26,570
Right, and you can
actually convince yourself

1149
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:31,910
why anything that
has the support that

1150
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:33,680
does not-- that depends
on the parameter

1151
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,310
is not going to be
part of this guy.

1152
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:37,460
It's kind of a hard thing to--

1153
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:42,330
in fact, you proved that it's
not and you prove this rule.

1154
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:43,850
That's kind of a
little difficult,

1155
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:46,190
but the way you can convince
yourself is that remember,

1156
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:49,910
the only interaction between
x and theta that I allowed

1157
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:51,470
was taking the
product of those guys

1158
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:54,160
and then the exponential, right?

1159
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:56,660
If you have something that
depends on some parameter--

1160
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:59,740
let's say you're going to see
something that looks like this.

1161
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:01,510
Right, for uniform,
it looks like this.

1162
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:08,210
Well, this is not of the form
exponential x times theta.

1163
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:10,990
There's an interaction
between x and theta here,

1164
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:12,840
but it's actually
certainly not of the form

1165
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,580
x exponential x times theta.

1166
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:16,680
So this is definitely
not going to be

1167
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,210
part of the exponential family.

1168
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:20,680
And every time you start
doing things like that,

1169
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:21,930
it's just not going to happen.

1170
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:28,370
Actually, to be fair,
I'm not even sure

1171
00:58:28,370 --> 00:58:30,680
that all these
guys, when you allow

1172
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:32,600
them to have all
their parameters free,

1173
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,810
are actually going
to be part of this.

1174
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:36,500
For example-- the
beta probably is,

1175
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:38,730
but I'm not actually
entirely convinced.

1176
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:47,320
There's books on
experiential families.

1177
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:48,970
All right, so let's go back.

1178
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:52,060
So here, we've put a lot
of effort understanding

1179
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:57,160
how big, how much wider than
the Gaussian distribution

1180
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:01,630
can we think of for the
conditional distribution

1181
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:04,030
of our response y given x.

1182
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:06,620
So let's go back to the
generalized linear models,

1183
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:07,120
right?

1184
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,870
So [INAUDIBLE] said, OK,
the random component?

1185
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:11,800
y has to be part of
some exponential family

1186
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,090
distribution-- check.

1187
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:14,726
We know what this means.

1188
00:59:14,726 --> 00:59:16,350
So now I have to
understand two things.

1189
00:59:16,350 --> 00:59:20,127
I have to understand what
is the expectation, right?

1190
00:59:20,127 --> 00:59:21,960
Because that's actually
what I model, right?

1191
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:24,160
I take the expectation, the
conditional expectation,

1192
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:24,850
of y given x.

1193
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:27,100
So I need to understand
given this guy,

1194
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:30,250
it would be nice if you had some
simple rules that would tell me

1195
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:32,950
exactly what the expectation
is rather than having to do it

1196
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:34,360
over and over again, right?

1197
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,100
If I told you,
here's a Gaussian,

1198
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,600
compute the
expectation, every time

1199
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:40,750
you had to use that would
be slightly painful.

1200
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:43,510
So hopefully, this thing
being simple enough--

1201
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:45,870
we've actually
selected a class that's

1202
00:59:45,870 --> 00:59:47,590
simple enough so that
we can have rules.

1203
00:59:47,590 --> 00:59:52,360
Whereas as soon as they give you
those parameters t1, t2, eta 1,

1204
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:55,810
eta 2, b and h, you can
actually have some simple rules

1205
00:59:55,810 --> 01:00:00,370
to compute the mean and
variance and all those things.

1206
01:00:00,370 --> 01:00:03,520
And so in particular, I'm
interested in the mean,

1207
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,950
and I'm going to have to
actually say, well, you know,

1208
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:09,770
this mean has to be mapped
into the whole real line.

1209
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:12,040
So I can actually talk
about modeling this function

1210
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:14,410
of the mean as x transpose beta.

1211
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:17,380
And we saw that for
the [INAUDIBLE] dataset

1212
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:21,400
or whatever other data sets.

1213
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,250
You actually can-- you can
actually do this using the log

1214
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:27,960
of the reciprocal or for the--

1215
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,050
oh, actually, we didn't
do it for the Bernoulli.

1216
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:30,940
We'll come to this.

1217
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:32,981
This is the most important
one, and that's called

1218
01:00:32,981 --> 01:00:34,510
a logit it or a logistic link.

1219
01:00:37,090 --> 01:00:39,230
But before we go there,
this was actually

1220
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:42,320
a very broad family, right?

1221
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,995
When I wrote this thing on the
bottom board-- it's gone now,

1222
01:00:44,995 --> 01:00:46,620
but when I wrote it
in the first place,

1223
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:48,870
the only thing that I wrote
is I wanted x times theta.

1224
01:00:48,870 --> 01:00:51,119
Wouldn't it be nice if you
have some distribution that

1225
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:53,230
was just x times theta,
not some function of x

1226
01:00:53,230 --> 01:00:54,660
times some function of theta?

1227
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:58,050
The functions seem to be
here so that they actually

1228
01:00:58,050 --> 01:01:02,610
make things a little--

1229
01:01:02,610 --> 01:01:05,160
so the functions were here
so that I can actually

1230
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:06,480
put a lot of functions there.

1231
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,430
But first of all,
if I actually decide

1232
01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:10,680
to re-parametrize my
problem, I can always

1233
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,180
assume-- if I'm
one dimensional, I

1234
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:14,970
can always assume
that eta 1 of theta

1235
01:01:14,970 --> 01:01:17,460
becomes my new theta, right?

1236
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:20,772
So this thing--
here for example,

1237
01:01:20,772 --> 01:01:22,230
I could say, well,
this is actually

1238
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:23,510
the parameter of my Bernoulli.

1239
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:25,950
Let me call this
guy theta, right?

1240
01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:28,230
I could do that.

1241
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:31,230
Then I could say, well, here
I have x that shows up here.

1242
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:33,980
And here since I'm talking
about the response,

1243
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:35,690
I cannot really make
any transformations.

1244
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:38,240
So here, I'm going to actually
talk about a specific family

1245
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:41,920
for which this guy is not x
square or square root of x

1246
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:43,350
or log of x or anything I want.

1247
01:01:43,350 --> 01:01:45,349
I'm just going to actually
look at distributions

1248
01:01:45,349 --> 01:01:46,430
for which this is x.

1249
01:01:46,430 --> 01:01:48,485
This exponential
families are called

1250
01:01:48,485 --> 01:01:51,140
a canonical exponential family.

1251
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:55,010
So in the canonical
exponential family, what I have

1252
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:57,230
is that I have my x times theta.

1253
01:01:57,230 --> 01:01:59,959
I'm going to allow myself
some normalization factor phi,

1254
01:01:59,959 --> 01:02:01,500
and we'll see, for
example, that it's

1255
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:05,330
very convenient when I talk
about the Gaussian, right?

1256
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:07,830
Because even if I know--

1257
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:15,134
yeah, even if I know this guy,
which I actually pull into my--

1258
01:02:15,134 --> 01:02:16,300
oh, that's over here, right?

1259
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:23,155
Right, I know sigma squared.

1260
01:02:23,155 --> 01:02:24,780
But I don't want to
change my parameter

1261
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:26,290
to be mu over sigma squared.

1262
01:02:26,290 --> 01:02:27,490
It's kind of painful.

1263
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:30,120
So I just take mu, and
I'm going to keep this guy

1264
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:31,980
as being this phi over there.

1265
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:34,830
And it's called the
dispersion parameter

1266
01:02:34,830 --> 01:02:38,010
from a clear analogy
with the Gaussian, right?

1267
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:41,580
That's the variance and
that's measuring dispersion.

1268
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:45,540
OK, so here, what
I want is I'm going

1269
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:49,450
to think throughout this class--
so phi may be known or not.

1270
01:02:49,450 --> 01:02:51,390
And depending--
when it's not known,

1271
01:02:51,390 --> 01:02:54,360
this actually might turn
into some exponential family

1272
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:55,470
or it might not.

1273
01:02:55,470 --> 01:03:01,380
And the main reason is because
this b of theta over phi

1274
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:04,950
is not necessarily a function
of theta over phi, right?

1275
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:09,660
If I actually have phi
unknown, then y theta over phi

1276
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:10,740
has to be--

1277
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:13,390
this guy has to be
my new parameter.

1278
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:17,930
And b might not be a function
of this new parameter.

1279
01:03:17,930 --> 01:03:21,860
OK, so in a way,
it may or may not,

1280
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:24,710
but this is not really a
concern that we're going to have

1281
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:26,810
because throughout
this class, we're

1282
01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:29,195
going to assume that
phi is known, OK?

1283
01:03:29,195 --> 01:03:31,820
Phi is going to be known all the
time, which means that this is

1284
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:34,334
always an exponential family.

1285
01:03:34,334 --> 01:03:35,750
And it's just the
simplest one you

1286
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:38,270
could think of-- one
dimensional parameter, one

1287
01:03:38,270 --> 01:03:42,800
dimensional response, and I just
have-- the product is just y

1288
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:45,050
times or, we used to call it x.

1289
01:03:45,050 --> 01:03:49,670
Now I've switched to y, but y
times theta divided by phi, OK?

1290
01:03:52,550 --> 01:03:56,120
Should I write this or this is
clear to everyone what this is?

1291
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:58,665
Let me write it somewhere so
we actually keep track of it

1292
01:03:58,665 --> 01:04:00,565
toward the [INAUDIBLE].

1293
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,990
OK, so this is--

1294
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:11,620
remember, we had all
the distributions.

1295
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:15,670
And then here we had
the exponential family.

1296
01:04:15,670 --> 01:04:18,610
And now we have the
canonical exponential family.

1297
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:24,200
It's actually
much, much smaller.

1298
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,950
Well, actually, it's probably
sort of a good picture.

1299
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:32,620
And what I have is that
my density or my PMF

1300
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:37,120
is just exponential
y times theta minus b

1301
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:41,020
of theta divided by phi.

1302
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:46,480
And I have plus phi of--

1303
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:53,820
oh, yeah, plus phi
of y phi, which

1304
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:58,680
means that this is really--
if phi is known, h of y

1305
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:05,742
is just exponential
c of y phi, agreed?

1306
01:05:05,742 --> 01:05:07,950
Actually, this is the reason
why it's not necessarily

1307
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:10,410
a canonical family.

1308
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:12,990
It might not be that
this depends only on y.

1309
01:05:12,990 --> 01:05:15,400
It could depend on y and
phi in some annoying way

1310
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:18,950
and I may not be
able to break it.

1311
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:21,220
OK, but if phi is known,
this is just a function

1312
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:23,580
that depends on y, agreed?

1313
01:05:28,290 --> 01:05:29,670
In particular, I
think you need--

1314
01:05:29,670 --> 01:05:31,753
I hope you can convince
yourself that this is just

1315
01:05:31,753 --> 01:05:33,750
a subcase of everything
we've seen before.

1316
01:05:41,990 --> 01:05:44,800
So for example, the Gaussian
when the variance is known

1317
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:47,010
is indeed of this form, right?

1318
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:49,220
So we still have
it on the board.

1319
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:51,040
So here is my y, right?

1320
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:53,950
So then let me write
this as f theta of y.

1321
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:59,030
So every x is replaceable
with y, blah, blah, blah.

1322
01:05:59,030 --> 01:06:01,330
This is this guy.

1323
01:06:01,330 --> 01:06:07,120
And now what I have is that
this is going to be my phi.

1324
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:10,630
This is my parameter of theta.

1325
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:14,320
So I'm definitely of the form
y times theta divided by phi.

1326
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:16,440
And then here I
have a function b

1327
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:20,890
that depends only on
theta over phi again.

1328
01:06:20,890 --> 01:06:27,040
So b of theta is mu
squared divided by 2.

1329
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,890
OK, then it's divided
by 6 sigma square.

1330
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:35,519
And then I have
this extra stuff.

1331
01:06:35,519 --> 01:06:37,310
But I really don't care
what it is for now.

1332
01:06:37,310 --> 01:06:42,140
It's just something that depends
only on y and known stuff.

1333
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:44,150
So it was just a function
of y just like my h.

1334
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:47,180
I stuff everything in there.

1335
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:50,090
The b, though, this
thing here, this

1336
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:52,229
is actually what's
important because

1337
01:06:52,229 --> 01:06:53,770
in the canonical
family, if you think

1338
01:06:53,770 --> 01:06:57,060
about it, when you know phi--

1339
01:06:57,060 --> 01:07:03,270
sorry-- right, this
is just y times theta

1340
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:05,790
scaled by a known
constant-- sorry, y times

1341
01:07:05,790 --> 01:07:08,160
theta scaled by a known
constant is the first term.

1342
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:12,000
The second term is b of theta
scaled by some known constant.

1343
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,860
But b of theta is
what's going to make

1344
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:17,580
the difference between the
Gaussian and Bernoullis

1345
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:19,680
and gammas and betas--

1346
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,750
this is all in this b
of theta. b of theta

1347
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:25,050
contains everything
that's idiosyncratic to

1348
01:07:25,050 --> 01:07:27,270
this particular distribution.

1349
01:07:27,270 --> 01:07:29,000
And so this is going
to be important.

1350
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,120
And we will see that b of theta
is going to capture information

1351
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:34,230
about the mean,
about the variance,

1352
01:07:34,230 --> 01:07:37,133
about likelihood,
about everything.

1353
01:07:44,710 --> 01:07:46,420
Should I go through
this computation?

1354
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:47,647
I mean, it's the same.

1355
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:48,730
We've just done it, right?

1356
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:53,750
So maybe it's probably better
if you can redo it on your own.

1357
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:56,680
All right, so the canonical
exponential family also

1358
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:58,210
has other distributions, right?

1359
01:07:58,210 --> 01:08:00,890
So there's the Gaussian
and there's the Poisson

1360
01:08:00,890 --> 01:08:02,410
and there's the Bernoulli.

1361
01:08:02,410 --> 01:08:05,250
But the other ones may not
be part of this, right?

1362
01:08:05,250 --> 01:08:07,810
In particular, think about
the gamma distribution.

1363
01:08:07,810 --> 01:08:13,600
We had this-- log x was one
of the things that showed up.

1364
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:15,670
I mean, I cannot get
rid of this log x.

1365
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:18,729
I mean, that's part of it
except if a is equal to 1

1366
01:08:18,729 --> 01:08:20,380
and I know it for sure, right?

1367
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:23,979
So if a is equal to 1, then
I'm going to have a minus 1,

1368
01:08:23,979 --> 01:08:25,000
which is equal to 0.

1369
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,160
So I'm going to have
a minus 1 times log

1370
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:28,630
x, which is going to be just 0.

1371
01:08:28,630 --> 01:08:30,560
So log x is going
to vanish from here.

1372
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:33,550
But if a is equal to 1,
then this distribution

1373
01:08:33,550 --> 01:08:36,250
is actually much nicer, and
it actually does not even

1374
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:37,450
deserve the name gamma.

1375
01:08:37,450 --> 01:08:38,890
What is it if a is equal to 1?

1376
01:08:42,444 --> 01:08:43,569
It's an exponential, right?

1377
01:08:43,569 --> 01:08:47,779
Gamma 1 is equal to 1. x to
the a minus 1 is equal to 1.

1378
01:08:47,779 --> 01:08:51,529
b-- so I have exponential
x over b divided by b.

1379
01:08:51,529 --> 01:08:53,520
So 1 over b-- call it lambda.

1380
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:56,759
And this is just an
exponential distribution.

1381
01:08:56,759 --> 01:08:58,800
And so every time you're
going to see something--

1382
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:02,590
so all these guys that
don't make it to this table,

1383
01:09:02,590 --> 01:09:06,094
they could be part of those
guys, but they're just more--

1384
01:09:06,094 --> 01:09:09,050
they're just to--

1385
01:09:09,050 --> 01:09:10,939
they just have another
name in this thing.

1386
01:09:10,939 --> 01:09:13,970
All right, so you could
compute the value of theta

1387
01:09:13,970 --> 01:09:15,520
for different values, right?

1388
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:18,714
So again, you still have some
continuous or discrete ones.

1389
01:09:18,714 --> 01:09:19,630
This is my b of theta.

1390
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:22,520
And I said this is actually
really what captures my theta.

1391
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:26,450
This b is actually called
cumulant generating function,

1392
01:09:26,450 --> 01:09:27,160
OK?

1393
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:28,300
I don't have time.

1394
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:30,370
I could write five
slides to explain to you,

1395
01:09:30,370 --> 01:09:32,729
but it would just only
tell you why it's called

1396
01:09:32,729 --> 01:09:34,390
cumulant generating function.

1397
01:09:34,390 --> 01:09:38,090
It's also known as the log of
the moment generating function.

1398
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:42,195
And the way it's called
cumulant generating function

1399
01:09:42,195 --> 01:09:44,320
is because if I start taking
successive derivatives

1400
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:47,584
and evaluating them at 0, I
get the successive cumulance

1401
01:09:47,584 --> 01:09:50,859
of this distribution, which
are some transformation

1402
01:09:50,859 --> 01:09:51,815
of the moments.

1403
01:09:51,815 --> 01:09:53,654
AUDIENCE: What are you
talking about again?

1404
01:09:53,654 --> 01:09:55,070
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
The function b.

1405
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:55,945
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1406
01:09:55,945 --> 01:09:57,986
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: So this
is just normalization.

1407
01:09:57,986 --> 01:10:00,170
So this is just to tell
you I can compute this,

1408
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:01,640
but I really don't care.

1409
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:04,460
And obviously I don't care
about stuff that's complicated.

1410
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:07,316
This is actually cute, and this
is what completes everything.

1411
01:10:07,316 --> 01:10:09,440
And the rest is just like
some general description.

1412
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,930
You only need to tell
you that the range of y

1413
01:10:11,930 --> 01:10:14,090
is 0 to infinity, right?

1414
01:10:14,090 --> 01:10:16,469
And that is
essentially telling me

1415
01:10:16,469 --> 01:10:19,010
this is going to give me some
hints as to which link function

1416
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:20,180
I should be using, right?

1417
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:21,710
Because the range
of y tells me what

1418
01:10:21,710 --> 01:10:23,846
the range of expectation
of y is going to be.

1419
01:10:23,846 --> 01:10:25,970
All right, so here, it
tells me that the range of y

1420
01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:28,850
is between 0 and 1.

1421
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:30,500
OK, so what I want
to show you is

1422
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:33,134
that this captures a
variety of different ranges

1423
01:10:33,134 --> 01:10:34,088
that you can have.

1424
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:46,570
OK, so I'm going to want
to go into the likelihood.

1425
01:10:46,570 --> 01:10:48,460
And the likelihood
I'm actually going

1426
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:50,780
to use to compute
the expectations.

1427
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:52,840
But since I actually
don't have time

1428
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:55,690
to do this now, let's just
go quickly through this

1429
01:10:55,690 --> 01:10:59,770
and give you spoiler alert to
make sure that you all wake up

1430
01:10:59,770 --> 01:11:01,270
on Thursday and
really, really want

1431
01:11:01,270 --> 01:11:03,160
to think about coming
here immediately.

1432
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:05,470
All right, so the thing
I'm going to want to do,

1433
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:07,570
as I said, is it would
be nice if, at least

1434
01:11:07,570 --> 01:11:11,434
for this canonical
family, when I give you b,

1435
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:12,850
you would be able
to say, oh, here

1436
01:11:12,850 --> 01:11:16,340
is a simple computation of b
that would actually give me

1437
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:17,530
the mean and the variance.

1438
01:11:17,530 --> 01:11:20,590
The mean and the variance
are also known as moments.

1439
01:11:20,590 --> 01:11:22,970
b is called cumulant
generating function.

1440
01:11:22,970 --> 01:11:24,940
So it sounds like
moments being related

1441
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:28,060
to cumulance, I might have a
path to finding those, right?

1442
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:31,660
And it might involve taking
derivatives of b, as we'll see.

1443
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:33,330
The way we're
going to prove this

1444
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:36,820
by using this thing that
we've used several times.

1445
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:39,354
So this property we use
when we're computing,

1446
01:11:39,354 --> 01:11:41,020
remember, the fisher
information, right?

1447
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:43,420
We had two formulas for
the fisher information.

1448
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:49,210
One was the expectation of the
second derivative of the log

1449
01:11:49,210 --> 01:11:53,026
likelihood, and one was negative
expectation of the square--

1450
01:11:53,026 --> 01:11:55,150
sorry, expectation of the
square, and the other one

1451
01:11:55,150 --> 01:11:57,970
was negative the expectation of
the second derivative, right?

1452
01:11:57,970 --> 01:12:00,850
The log likelihood is concave,
so this number is negative,

1453
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:02,470
this number is positive.

1454
01:12:02,470 --> 01:12:04,990
And the way we did this is by
just permuting some derivative

1455
01:12:04,990 --> 01:12:06,004
and integral here.

1456
01:12:06,004 --> 01:12:08,170
And there was just-- we
used the fact that something

1457
01:12:08,170 --> 01:12:09,378
that looked like this, right?

1458
01:12:09,378 --> 01:12:13,780
The log likelihood
is log of f theta.

1459
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:20,500
And when I take the derivative
of this guy with respect

1460
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:24,690
to theta, then I
have something that

1461
01:12:24,690 --> 01:12:30,460
looks like the derivative
divided by f theta.

1462
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:34,020
And if I start taking the
integral against f theta

1463
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:39,270
of this thing, so the
expectation of this thing,

1464
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:42,420
those things would cancel.

1465
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:45,739
And then I had just the
integral of a derivative, which

1466
01:12:45,739 --> 01:12:48,030
I would make a leap of faith
and say that it's actually

1467
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:49,321
the derivative of the integral.

1468
01:12:53,770 --> 01:12:56,000
But this was equal to 1.

1469
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,404
So this derivative was
actually equal to 0.

1470
01:12:58,404 --> 01:13:00,320
And so that's how you
got that the expectation

1471
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,930
of the derivative of the log
likelihood is equal to 0.

1472
01:13:02,930 --> 01:13:04,940
And you do it once again
and you get this guy.

1473
01:13:04,940 --> 01:13:06,350
It's just some nice
things that happen

1474
01:13:06,350 --> 01:13:08,433
with the [INAUDIBLE] taking
derivative of the log.

1475
01:13:08,433 --> 01:13:10,430
We've done that,
we'll do that again.

1476
01:13:10,430 --> 01:13:13,660
But once you do this, you
can actually apply it.

1477
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:17,580
And-- missing a
parenthesis over there.

1478
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:19,610
So when you write
the log likelihood,

1479
01:13:19,610 --> 01:13:21,266
it's just log of an exponential.

1480
01:13:21,266 --> 01:13:22,640
Huh, that's actually
pretty nice.

1481
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:25,020
Just like the least squares
came naturally, the least

1482
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:26,436
squares [INAUDIBLE]
came naturally

1483
01:13:26,436 --> 01:13:29,204
when we took the log
likelihood of the Gaussians,

1484
01:13:29,204 --> 01:13:31,370
we're going to have the
same thing that happens when

1485
01:13:31,370 --> 01:13:33,080
I take the log of the density.

1486
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:35,300
The exponential is
going to go away,

1487
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:36,990
and then I'm going
to use this formula.

1488
01:13:36,990 --> 01:13:39,770
But this formula is
going to actually give me

1489
01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:43,026
an equation directly--
oh, that's where it was.

1490
01:13:43,026 --> 01:13:44,840
So that's the one
that's missing up there.

1491
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:49,010
And so the expectation
minus this thing

1492
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:50,780
is going to be equal
to 0, which tells me

1493
01:13:50,780 --> 01:13:53,122
that the expectation
is just the derivative.

1494
01:13:53,122 --> 01:13:55,190
Right, so it's still
a function of theta,

1495
01:13:55,190 --> 01:13:57,410
but it's just a derivative of b.

1496
01:13:57,410 --> 01:13:59,660
And the variance
is just going to be

1497
01:13:59,660 --> 01:14:01,280
the second derivative of b.

1498
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,910
But remember, this was some
sort of a scaling, right?

1499
01:14:03,910 --> 01:14:05,990
It's called the
dispersion parameter.

1500
01:14:05,990 --> 01:14:09,410
So if I had a Gaussian and
the variance of the Gaussian

1501
01:14:09,410 --> 01:14:12,020
did not depend on
the sigma squared

1502
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:15,260
which I stuffed in this phi,
that would be certainly weird.

1503
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:17,601
And it cannot depend only
on mu, and so this will--

1504
01:14:17,601 --> 01:14:19,850
for the Gaussian, this is
definitely going to be equal

1505
01:14:19,850 --> 01:14:20,960
to 1.

1506
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:24,350
And this is just going to
be equal to my variance.

1507
01:14:24,350 --> 01:14:28,460
So this is just by taking
the second derivative.

1508
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:33,260
So basically, the take-home
message is that this function b

1509
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:35,170
captures--

1510
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:37,090
by taking one derivative
of the expectation

1511
01:14:37,090 --> 01:14:39,565
and by taking two derivatives
captures the variance.

1512
01:14:39,565 --> 01:14:41,200
Another thing
that's actually cool

1513
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:42,580
and we'll come
back to this and I

1514
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:45,640
want to think about is if
this second derivative is

1515
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:49,190
the variance, what can
I say about this thing?

1516
01:14:52,037 --> 01:14:53,370
What do I know about a variance?

1517
01:14:53,370 --> 01:14:54,950
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1518
01:14:54,950 --> 01:14:56,730
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
Yeah, that's positive.

1519
01:14:56,730 --> 01:14:58,110
So I know that this is positive.

1520
01:14:58,110 --> 01:15:00,600
So what does that tell me?

1521
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:03,115
Positive?

1522
01:15:03,115 --> 01:15:03,990
That's convex, right?

1523
01:15:03,990 --> 01:15:07,050
A function that has positive
second derivative is convex.

1524
01:15:07,050 --> 01:15:09,700
So we're going to use
that as well, all right?

1525
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:12,530
So yeah, I'll see
you on Thursday.

1526
01:15:12,530 --> 01:15:14,380
I have your homework.
