    "# Contextual Bandit\n",
    "In the original multi-armed bandit problem discussed in Part 1, there is only a single bandit, which can be thought of as like a slot-machine. The range of actions available to the agent consist of pulling one of multiple arms of the bandit. By doing so, a reward of +1 or -1 is received at different rates. The problem is considered solved if the agent learns to always choose the arm that most often provides a positive reward. In such a case, we can design an agent that completely ignores the state of the environment, since for all intents and purposes, there is only ever a single, unchanging state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contextual Bandits introduce the concept of the state. The state consists of a description of the environment that the agent can use to take more informed actions. In our problem, instead of a single bandit, there can now be multiple bandits. The state of the environment tells us which bandit we are dealing with, and the goal of the agent is to learn the best action not just for a single bandit, but for any number of them. Since each bandit will have different reward probabilities for each arm, our agent will need to learn to condition its action on the state of the environment. Unless it does this, it wonâ€™t achieve the maximum reward possible over time. In order to accomplish this, we will be building a single-layer neural network in Tensorflow that takes a state and produces an action. By using a policy-gradient update method, we can have the network learn to take actions that maximize its reward. Below is the iPython notebook walking through the tutorial."

    "Here we define our contextual bandits. In this example, we are using three four-armed bandit. What this means is that each bandit has four arms that can be pulled. Each bandit has different success probabilities for each arm, and as such requires different actions to obtain the best result. The pullBandit function generates a random number from a normal distribution with a mean of 0. The lower the bandit number, the more likely a positive reward will be returned. We want our agent to learn to always choose the bandit-arm that will most often give a positive reward, depending on the Bandit presented."

This allows the agent to take actions which are conditioned on the state of the environment, a critical step toward being able to solve full RL problems. The agent uses a single set of weights, within which each value is an estimate of the value of the return from choosing a particular arm given a bandit. We use a policy gradient method to update the agent by moving the value for the selected action toward the recieved reward."
